        <p id="creative">My name is Nehemiah Wilson, and I am a rising third-
            year computational media at Georgia Tech with a passion for artistry.
            From the day I received my first iPod Touch as a gift for my eleventh birthday, 
            I’ve had a desire to create stunning visual art. From that point on, 
            I continued refining my creative eye for photography through the camera 
            lenses of various smartphones I acquired. <br><br>

            It wasn’t until the summer of 2017 that I began truly challenging myself with 
            photography. Wanting to share my work with the world, I made a VSCO account during 
            a family reunion trip to Atlanta. I posted pictures of whatever I could find in my 
            environment. Buildings. Streets. Signs. Bathroom faucets. Table centerpieces. Light 
            fixtures. I loved the inspiration I was able to gain by scrolling through the VSCO 
            app. Seeing the creativity in others drove me to experiment with very abstract and 
            unconventional photos (like taking a picture of a bathroom faucet!). For the next 
            couple of years, I challenged myself through mobile photography to create art that 
            I loved. <br><br>

            As a student at Georgia Tech, I had the unique opportunity to intern with Google in 
            New York City in the summer of 2019. After pushing the limits of mobile photography 
            for several years, I decided it was finally time to buy a DSLR camera to continue my 
            creative growth. I was out almost every weekend honing my street photography skills 
            around the city or refining my portrait photography skills at various meetups organized 
            by local creatives. During this time, I also invested in Lightroom and Photoshop to learn 
            how to edit photos, and I posted them to an Instagram account I created for my photography 
            work. This account quickly gained traction as I was meeting and connecting with people around 
            the city. It was through this account that I connected with Marcellus Walls. <br><br>

            Throughout my career, I’ve been connected to creatives and executives in the Christian Hip Hop 
            industry and have had opportunities to shoot notable artists like Lecrae, 1K Phew, nobigdyl., 
            and WHATUPRG. From my time in New York City and through various opportunities here in Atlanta, 
            I built my portfolio and created my brand shotByNehemiah.</p>
